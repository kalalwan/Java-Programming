# Java-Programming - Unconstrainted Optimization
Gradient Descent Algorithm with 3 line-search methods:

1. Fixed Line Search (fixed)
2. Armijo Backtracking Rule (armijo)
3. Golden Section Search (gss)

Program takes in an n-dimentional polynomial in the form of a CSV file and performs gradient descent to find a local minimum.
